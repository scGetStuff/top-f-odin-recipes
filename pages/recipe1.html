        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"This recipe was given to me by my Italian mother-in-law. It is the type of crustless cheesecake that is sold
            in Italian bakeries in New York. I usually make it with whole-milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat.
            This is not a diet item! You can add fresh fruit topping if you desire."</p>
